            <h2>Learn to enjoy every minute of your life.</h2>
            <p>"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every
                minute should be enjoyed and savored"<br/> Earl Nightingale</p>

            <p>“Enjoy every moment of life because you don’t know what will happen tomorrow”. Don’t spend your entire life without enjoying because you will regret when you will look back. You don’t know what lies ahead so enjoy the present and cherish every
                moment of life. In life, every moment is filled with the happiness you just need to see.
